  <p>[Verse 1]
    <br>I was just an only child of the universe
    <br>And then I found you, and then I found you
    <br>You are the sun and I am just the planets
    <br>Spinning around you, spinning around you
    <br>You were too good to be true, gold plated
    <br>But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
    <br>I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
    <br>But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah
  </p>
  <p>[Chorus]
    <br>'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
    <br>Write our names in the wet concrete
    <br>I wonder if your therapist knows
    <br>Everything about me
    <br>I'm here in search of your glory
    <br>There's been a million before me
    <br>That ultra-kind of love
    <br>You never walk away from
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
  </p>
  <p>[Verse 2]
    <br>I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
    <br>But only for you, but only for you
    <br>My head is stripped just like a screw
    <br>that's been tightened too many times
    <br>When I think of you, when I think of you
    <br>I will shield you from the waves if they find you
    <br>I will protect you, I will protect you
    <br>Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
    <br>Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah
  </p>
  <p>[Chorus]
    <br>'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
    <br>Write our names in the wet concrete
    <br>I wonder if your therapist knows
    <br>Everything about me
    <br>I'm here in search of your glory
    <br>There's been a million before me
    <br>That ultra-kind of love
    <br>You never walk away from
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
  </p>
  <p>[Bridge]
    <br>I'm here, at the beginning of the end
    <br>Oh, the end of infinity with you
    <br>I'm here, at the beginning of the end
    <br>Oh, the end of inrfinity with you
    <br>I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
    <br>Oh, you drain all the fear from me
    <br>I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
    <br>You drain the fear from me
  </p>
  <p>[Chorus]
    <br>'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
    <br>Write our names in the wet concrete
    <br>I wonder if your therapist knows
    <br>Everything about me
    <br>I'm here in search of your glory
    <br>There's been a million before me
    <br>That ultra-kind of love
    <br>You never walk away from
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
    <br>(You're just the last of the real ones)
    <br>You're just the last of the real ones
