  <p>[Verse 1: Patrick Stump]
    <br>I thought of angels
    <br>Choking on their halos
    <br>Get them drunk on rose water
    <br>See how dirty I can get them
    <br>Pulling out their fragile teeth
    <br>And clip their tiny wings
    <br>
    <br>[Pre-Chorus: Patrick]
    <br>Anything you say can and will be held against you
    <br>So only say my name
    <br>It will be held against you
    <br>Anything you say can and will be held against you
    <br>So only say my name
    <br>
    <br>[Chorus: Patrick & Foxes]
    <br>If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
    <br>Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
    <br>Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>
    <br>[Verse 2: Patrick & Foxes]
    <br>Letting people down is my thing baby
    <br>Find yourself a new gig
    <br>This town ain’t big enough for two of us
    <br>I don’t have the right name
  <br>Or the right looks
    <br>But I have twice the heart
    <br>
    <br>[Pre-Chorus: Patrick]
    <br>Anything you say can and will be held against you
    <br>So only say my name
    <br>It will be held against you
    <br>Anything you say can and will be held against you
    <br>So only say my name (name)
    <br>
    <br>[Chorus: Patrick & Foxes]
    <br>If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
    <br>Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
    <br>Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>
    <br>[Bridge: Foxes]
    <br>If I spilled my guts
    <br>The world would never look at you the same way
    <br>And now I’m here to give you all of my love (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
    <br>So I can watch your face as I take it all away (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh)
    <br>
    <br>[Chorus: Patrick & Foxes]
    <br>If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
    <br>Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
    <br>Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
    <br>(I know I’m bad news)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>(I saved it all for you)
    <br>For just one yesterday
    <br>
    <br>[Outro]
    <br>Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    <br>Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    <br>Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
    <br>Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
